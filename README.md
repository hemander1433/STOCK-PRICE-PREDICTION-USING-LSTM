# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-LSTM


Hereâ€™s a detailed project description for your Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks that you can use on GitHub to make the project clear and easy to understand for anyone who browses through it:

Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks
Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known for its capability to model sequential data. The model is trained on historical stock prices, learning the patterns and trends to forecast future prices. We use stock price data as time series data, and the model utilizes past closing prices to predict future closing prices.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Preprocess historical stock price data.
Prepare the data for input into an LSTM model.
Build and train the LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
Key Components
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Historical stock price data is obtained from a financial data source (such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other APIs).
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and create features from the historical prices (lag features).
The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.
Feature Engineering:

The closing price of each stock is used as the target variable.
Lag features are created to predict the future price based on the past (e.g., Close(t-1), Close(t-2)).
Model Architecture:

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to learn the temporal dependencies in the stock price data.
The model architecture includes:
LSTM layers to learn from sequences of past stock prices.
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
A Dense layer for output prediction.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The LSTM model is trained using the training dataset.
The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset.
Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy.
Model Prediction:

Once trained, the model can make predictions on unseen data (future stock prices).
